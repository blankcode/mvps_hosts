# mvps_hosts

mvsp-update.sh - MAC (Maybe BSD UNIX as well) Updates the Local HOSTS file with the HOSTS file from https://winhelp2002.mvps.org/hosts.htm. It's easy to add as a CRON job to check for new files and and apply them unattended. I made this for a elderly relative originally and it's continued to perform well.
