# mvps_hosts

**mvsp-update.sh** - MAC (Maybe BSD UNIX as well) Updates the Local HOSTS file with the HOSTS file from https://winhelp2002.mvps.org/hosts.htm. It's easy to add as a CRON job to check for new files and and apply them unattended. I made this for a elderly relative originally and it's continued to perform well.

**mvsp-update-new.sh** - MAC Added check to stop being a "cowboy". This will also be the template for futher versions.

- **To Come** - Validate operation on Linux or, create a variant for Linux.
